<h1>Sorting Algorithms Visualiser</h1>

Welcome to the sorting algorithms visualiser!

I built this app simply because I find it fascinating how algorithms can transform such a complex arrangement of bars into a perfectly aligned ramp.
You can easily see how different algorithms become much faster/slower as you increase the array size which proves the importance of selecting the right one in your applications when sorting data.

The app is very simple and intuitive to use. Have fun playing around with the settings to see the algorithms in action!
